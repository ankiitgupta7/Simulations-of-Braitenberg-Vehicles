## 1. What this is about?
This is the implementation of my Braitenberg Vehicle Simulation Proposal, submitted for International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility ([INCF](https://www.incf.org/)) at Google Summer of Code, 2019. The prototype developed during proposal making period can be seen [here](https://github.com/ankiitgupta7/Simulations-of-Braitenberg-Vehicles/tree/master/Prototype). It was done using [Turtle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html). The content of proposal idea can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=10oOEA-JDcRCXqQFo1aB8Hm-UIsu4KFgi).<br><br>
The present simulation uses [Processing.py](https://py.processing.org/) for UI support. The code written here are based upon ideas described in the book by the neuroscientist [Valentino Braitenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentino_Braitenberg) in his classic book "Vehicles: Experiments in Synthetic Psychology" (1984). The book describes how hypothetical analog vehicles (a combination of sensors, actuators and their interconnections), though simple in design, can exhibit behaviors akin to aggression, love, foresight, and optimism. So, we would see these meaningful behaviours emerge from vehicles as they interact with stimuli in the environment through the programmed simulation.

## 2. What is to be done?

## 3. The Braitenberg Vehicle
A Braitenberg vehicle is an agent that can autonomously move around based on its sensor inputs. It has primitive sensors that measure some stimulus at a point, and wheels (each driven by its own motor) that function as actuators or effectors.

Depending on how sensors and wheels are connected, the vehicle exhibits different behaviors (which can be goal-oriented). This means that, depending on the sensor-motor wiring, it appears to strive to achieve certain situations and to avoid others, changing course when the situation changes.
