# Simulations-of-Braitenberg-Vehicles
The repository is about simulations of Braitenberg Vehicles and develop a nervous system  decision making. 
The idea is to implement a nervous system in the vehicle which should be efficient in decision making given the environmental stimuli. I have broken down this task into following subtasks to be completed in three phases. Relevant data and details are in folder for the respective phase. 
  * Setting up the environment [Phase 1]
  * Labeling the stimuli [Phase 2]
  * Decision Making based on labeling [Phase 3]
  
For the time being the repository has prototype for phases 1 and 3 and it would be updated as progress is made in each phase.
